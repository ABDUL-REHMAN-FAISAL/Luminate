- Analytics dashboard showing application statistics and job posting performance

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Extend the existing database models to include employer profiles
- Create new templates for employer-specific views
- Add authentication to distinguish between job seekers and employers

## 2. Interview Scheduling System

**Description:** Streamline the interview process with an integrated scheduling system.

**Key Components:**
- Calendar integration for employers to set available time slots
- Interview request system for candidates to select preferred times
- Automated email notifications for interview confirmations and reminders
- Video conferencing integration options (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.)

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Add new database models for interview scheduling
- Implement calendar visualization using JavaScript libraries
- Set up email notification system

## 3. Messaging System

**Description:** Enable direct communication between employers and candidates within the platform.

**Key Components:**
- Thread-based messaging interface
- Real-time notifications for new messages
- Message templates for common communications
- Attachment support for sharing documents

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Create database models for message storage
- Implement WebSocket for real-time functionality
- Design responsive UI for messaging across devices

## 4. Skill Endorsements

**Description:** Allow previous employers or colleagues to endorse candidates' skills, adding credibility to profiles.

**Key Components:**
- Endorsement request system
- Skill verification badges on profiles
- Endorsement management for users
- Integration with the existing skills tracking system

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Extend the User and Skills models to include endorsement data
- Implement email invitation system for requesting endorsements
- Create verification process for endorsers

## 5. Personalized Learning Recommendations

**Description:** Suggest courses, tutorials, and resources to help candidates develop missing skills for desired positions.

**Key Components:**
- Skill gap analysis based on job applications and matches
- Integration with learning platforms (Coursera, Udemy, etc.)
- Progress tracking for skill development
- Recommendation engine based on career goals

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Create a learning resources database or API integration
- Implement algorithms to identify skill gaps from job applications
- Design an intuitive UI for learning recommendations

## 6. Enhanced Authentication System

**Description:** Implement a robust authentication system with multiple sign-in options and security features.

**Key Components:**
- Social media login integration (Google, LinkedIn, GitHub)
- Two-factor authentication
- Password recovery system
- Session management and security features

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Integrate Flask-Login or similar authentication extension
- Implement OAuth for third-party login options
- Add security measures for protecting user data

## 7. Advanced Skill Matching Algorithms

**Description:** Enhance the existing skill matching system with more sophisticated algorithms.

**Key Components:**
- Natural language processing for skill extraction from resumes and job descriptions
- Weighted skill matching based on importance and relevance
- Machine learning models to improve match quality over time
- Visualization of skill match analysis

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Integrate NLP libraries for text processing
- Develop more complex matching algorithms
- Create a feedback loop for improving match quality

## 8. Mobile Application

**Description:** Develop a mobile application to provide on-the-go access to the platform.

**Key Components:**
- Job search and application capabilities
- Push notifications for application updates and messages
- Profile management
- Interview scheduling and reminders

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Create a RESTful API for the existing backend
- Develop native or cross-platform mobile applications
- Ensure responsive design for all features

## Implementation Priority
